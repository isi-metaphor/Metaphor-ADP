# Knowledge Base Scripts
Jonathan Gordon, 2014-07-23

This directory contains the scripts that were in the repository for
acting on or generating KBs. They are poorly documented but have been
slighty cleaned up and been grouped with their various inputs and
outputs.

- `check-arities`: For a KB (passed as a filename or stdin), print any
  predicates that are used with more than one arity (number of
  arguments).
