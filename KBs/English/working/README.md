# README: KBs/English/working
Jonathan Gordon, 2014-06-13

Assorted files separated from the main KB in the parent directory:
- en-conflict.txt: English lexical axioms for conflicts (war, sports,
  competition). These should eventually be merged into the main axioms
  for the Competition schema.
- en-wordnet.txt: An old axiomatization of WordNet, which hurt
  source/target mapping precision.
