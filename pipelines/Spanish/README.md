Spanish Semantic Parsing Pipeline
=================================

This file describes the Spanish semantic parsing pipeline. It has directions
for running the pipeline, as well as descriptions of the scripts, tools, and
resources used within the pipeline.


### Running the pipeline

```
./run_spanish.sh [<absolute path to input> [<absolute path to output>]]
```

To run the pipeline, call run_spanish.sh with the absolute path to the input
file as an argument. By default the system outputs the logical forms of the
sentences in the input file to stdout. The second (optional) argument can be a
file or a directory. If the optional argument is a file, the system output
will be redirected there. If it is a directory, the intermediate files
(tokenized, tagged, etc.) will be put into that directory, and the final
output will go to stdout.


### Subdirectories

**Scripts**
- to_malt.py - Create conll style output. Input file should be output from treetagger. Outputs to stdout.
   - To run: 

```
python to_malt.py -i <input_file>
```

- malt_to_prop.py - Create logical form output. Input file should be output from MaltParser. Outputs to stdout.
   - To run: 

```
python malt_to_prop.py -i <input_file>
```


**Examples**
 - spanish_text.txt - raw file (one sentence per line) of spanish text collected from web
   - spanish_text.tree.tagged - POS tagged spanish_text
   - spanish_text.conll - spanish_text input for MaltParser
   - spanish_text.conll.malt - dependency parsed output of spanish_text
   - spanish_text.props - logical forms of spanish_text
 - spanish_metaphors.txt - raw file (one sentence per line) of spanish metaphor test sentences
   - spanish_text.tree.tagged - POS tagged spanish_metaphors
   - spanish_text.conll - spanish_metaphors input for MaltParser
   - spanish_text.conll.malt - dependency parsed output of spanish_metaphors
   - spanish_text.props - logical forms of spanish_metaphors
 - spanish_translations.txt - raw file of sentences from pipelines/README.md translated into Spanish
   - spanish_text.tree.tagged - POS tagged spanish_translations
   - spanish_text.conll - spanish_translations input for MaltParser
   - spanish_text.conll.malt - dependency parsed output of spanish_translations
   - spanish_text.props - logical forms of spanish_translations

### External Tools & Resources

- Tokenization
 - nltk_tokenize.py - Written by Vladamir Zaytsev
   - uses nltk.tokenize (PunktSentenceTokenizer,WordPunctTokenizer, and TreebankWordTokenizer)
- POS Tagging
 - treetagger 3.2 (http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/)
   - Spanish parameter file available from the same page
- Parsing
  - MaltParser 1.5 (http://www.maltparser.org/download.html)
     - training corpus: Ancora (http://clic.ub.edu/corpus/en)



**Preprocessing for Dependency Parsing**

NOTE: These steps do not need to be re-run.

1. Created conll-style file using instances from the Ancora corpus > ancora.malt

2. Made MaltParser model with maltparse1.5 using ancora.malt > ancora.model
